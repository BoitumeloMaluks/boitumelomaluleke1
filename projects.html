        <br> <p>Alarm Clock Project</p> <br>
        <summary>This Python-based Alarm Clock application is designed with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter. 
         The program offers several functionalities, including the display of the current time in real-time. Users can conveniently set alarms by choosing specific hours and minutes from dropdown menus provided within the interface. 
         It allows users to activate or deactivate alarms at their convenience. When the set alarm time aligns with the current time, the application triggers an alarm sound to notify the user. Additionally, a countdown timer displays the time remaining until the alarm goes off, enhancing user awareness. 
         The application also includes a snooze feature, enabling users to temporarily pause the alarm by specifying a snooze duration, which is visualized through a countdown timer. </summary>
